It's crazy to think that only a handful of months ago I was just beginning to learn how to code.  I didn't know what an array was, I had no idea how to make an API, and I sure as heck didn't know how to make an app.  Now, I've made a few.  I know new things, and I never thought I would make it as far as I did.  I wanted to take my last blog and make it about my journey at Flatiron, and the road that brought me here.

### The Journey's Early Stages

When starting at Flatiron, I had close to zero knowledge of software engineering.  I was a photographer, video editor, and working in the film industry.  But I had a passion to create, and a passion for technology.  I took a leap of faith a dropped everything to come to a school I knew nothing about, to learn a profession that was going to be difficult.  After the first project, a quick CLI that was able to scrape and sort some computers, I felt like I was on top of the world.  And that was the first life lesson I learned at Flatiron- "Success feels good."

### Roadblocks

How many roadblocks did I encounted, you might be wondering?  Too many.  Every project, every lesson, and every day presented more and more obsticles to traverse. Being consistantly defeated with broken code, big red letters telling me my app didn't work,  and a few hundred panic attacks that I wouldn't finish a project in time can really start to wear down spirits.  That was the next lesson learned from this chapter in my life- "Don't give up."

There were probably a hundred times when I though I wouldn't succeed, and in the end it made me try that much harder.  It made me that much more determined to learn how to make my applications work.  I mean, the whole reason I was here was to learn, right?  Through my consistant failures, I became more determined to learn.

### Finally at the End

Finally, everything I worked towards was finished.  I was able to hone my skills coding, but I also was able to build myself up emotionally and mentally, and I came out of this "semester" not only a stronger coder, but a stronger person.

The life lessons learned here and just as good as the practical.  Don't give up, keep your eye on the prize, and code on!
