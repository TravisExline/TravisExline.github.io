****A Quick Introduction

Oh boy a blog! I guess first an foremost I should introduce myself.  I'm a big movie and gamer nerd, so prepare yourself for the movie puns. I'm a lizard lover, Dungeons & Dragons player. and moderately okay cook, and I look forward to sharing the next few months of my programming life with anyone who cares to take a peek.

****Where I Started

A journey to learn something new is never easy, never stressless, and always an amazing and unforgetable experience.  After only 3 weeks, I can whole heartedly report that the previous statement holds more true than ever when learning code. 

My quest to success started only a few months before my enrollment into Flatiron.  I had recently graduated from Loras College with a Degree in Media Studies with an Emphesis on Creative Production and Editing; In short, I was a photographer, videographer, and editor. I loved it, but getting a job was near impossible without being in Hollywood, and that really wasn't on my radar. About a year and a half after graduating and working a 9-5, I decided it was time for a career change.  Programming caught my eye instantly.  Being a creative, this line of work is an ultimate form of creating in my mind - something from nothing, not just replicating images through stills or video. I always had anaffinity with computers and technology, so I dove in headfirst....

...And completely whacked the bottom of the pool when I did.  I felt like the Fellowship when they left Rivendell; Confident and ready to take on the world.  Boy was I wrong.  It was difficult.  I won't lie, I almost didn't follow through with it. That would've been a terrible choice, huh? 3 weeks in, and I couldn't be happier that I kept keeping at this crazy journey.  I went from not knowing what a method or object was, to being able to comprehend aspects of technology that I never knew existed.

****Expectations

What did I expect from all this? Well, I expected exactly what was advertised: A coding BOOTCAMP.  Lots of hard work, some long hours, and a single tear falling down my face.  I was wrong... Again.  Hard work and long hours are an understatement.  Coding quickly became my lifestyle and infiltrated, honestly, a good portion of my life.  Playing World of Warcraft with your friends isn't just playing a game anymore, it's thinking, "Huh, I wonder if they used *insert aspect of programming here* in *insert aspect of game here*."  It's a complete transformation that's being instilled, and it's pretty cool. 

There's a long road ahead.  Did Frodo destroy the Ring in one movie? Did the Avengers succeed on their first try? Nope, and those fictional depictions of success are what's going to help me sleep at night.
